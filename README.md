# DiletsAdventure
Yes, the long awaited sequel to DiletVsTelid is here, with MAJOR gameplay changes. Still made with processing. <br>
The general goal is going to be Doom but 2D, and with Dilet. <br>
Current to-dos: mouse-relative WASD, rotation of the sprite to follow the mouse relative to the X/Y axis, dash function, finalization of perspective (full top down or pokemon-eque), literally everything else regarding a full game. Maybe i should just make a have-done section.<br>
Current have-dones: Made a functioning window, rudimentary basic player functions, rudimentary octi-direction WASD movement, fullscreen implementation. Have yet to figure out size of player on screen.
Next minor goal: the "deathmatch box" from Quake but here, with all weapons functioning. Sadly due to "engine" limitations no actual fragging will occur, but dummies should suffice.
Next smol goal: MOUSE
