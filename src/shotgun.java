//TODO: This is a seperate class of weapon than hitscan or projectile, due to the unique nature of the projectiles.
// "Projectiles" will originate at the same point, but we will take in parameters for the "spread" and amount of projectiles.
// The "spread" refers to the degrees offset from the line formed by the player's coordinates and their cursor position.
